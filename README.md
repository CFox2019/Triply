# Welcome to Triply

Triply is a travel planner that provides weather data for each day of trip.

# Optional "Ways to Stand Out" features

• Add end date and display length of trip.
• Use Local Storage to save the data so that when they close, then revisit the page, their information is still there.
• Instead of just pulling a single day forecast, pull the forecast for multiple days.
